# Android Code New User + Google Firebase's Firestore
Sample Android Code with a simple "new user" form interface that takes the name and email and then stores this in a connected (and previously setup) Google Cloud Firebase's Firestore instance in a collection called users.  

### NOTE: The google-services.json file that is in the main app directory is not present
You will need to create your own Google Cloud Account + Project with Firestore and users collection and register your own app with the project using your own credentials and download the corresponding google-services.json file for use.
